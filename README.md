Simple Image host with the help of PHP and subdomain

Just upload it and start using, its just project i used to add images from admin panel by the help of an iframe i added in my admin panel.

To get it working with a subdomain point your subdomain to upload directory and change the line 25 to reflect your subdomain instead of main path. I used it as i.example/md5image.png and it worked pretty well.
